        Welcome to the best place to level up your coding ability.

      <p>
        Dear, student. This is Ryan. 
        I graduated magna cum laude with a Bacehlor's in 
        Physics and Mathematics (double major) from a liberal arts college
        in 2015. I earned my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics
        from the University of Michigan in 2021.
        After living in MÃ¼nchen, Deutschland (Munich, Germany) for
        nearly two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the
        Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, I served as a Visiting
        Assistant Professor of Physics at Purdue University Fort Wayne.
      </p>
      <p>
        My former students have seriously leveled up their coding abilities,
        and as a result, successfully landed summer internshipts at Cambridge,
        the European Space Agency, and Oxford. Former students received PhD offers
        from Toledo University and the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics.
        My colleagues hail from Princeton University, Caltech, Cornell,
        University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Chicago, Stanford, and many more.        
      </p>
      <p>
        My research involves how galaxies make stars, dark matter, and black holes
        using computational methods. As such, I am well versed
        in a variety of fields, spanning physics, mathematics, computer science, and data science.
        I run my simulations on some of the world's largest supercomputers.
        Therefore, developing efficient code in Python, C++, C, and Fortran is my bread & butter :)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked with over a dozen undergraduate and several graduate
        students one-on-one, teaching them from the ground-up how to use
        Python, Unix, solve differential equations, etc. to the point they ran
        their own simulations and published their research in internationally
        respected journals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have instructed over a thousand students in introductory Physics
        and Astronomy classes over the past decade.
