      <p>
        Ryan Jeffrey Farber, PhD, has 1-2 openings for astrophysics research
        experiences this summer.

        Project 1: BLACK HOLE ACCRETION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY.
        Application Deadline: July 1st, 2024.

        Background:
        A star's life exists as a constant competition between gravitational
        collapse, and the production of pressure gradients in resistance.
        For the most massive stars, gravity wins forming an object so compact
        that even light cannot escape its gravitational influence: a black hole.

        Previous work:
        Last summer, I supervised a student who performed her own 2D computational
        fluid dynamic simulations of the Keplerian subsonic regimes of black hole
        accretion disks. She compared the accretion rates predicted by
        astrophysical codes FLASH and Athena. Currently, my student is writing up 
        the results of her research for publication as a Research Note of the 
        American Astronomical Society, as she is about to begin an internship 
        this summer with the European Space Agency. Additionally, she was accepted 
        for a masters program at Dundee University to study the light curves 
        produced by black hole accretion disks.

        Example Project:
        I am looking for a student interested in significantly extending our
        previous work either by i) comparing additional astrophysical codes, such
        as Ramses, Athena++, Arepo, Gizmo, etc., ii) studying additional astrophysical
        regimes for black hole accretion: supersonic, magnetized, and/or relativistic,
        or iii) a more self-consistent treatment of the onset of accretion, by
        simulating the Roche overflow of a companion star.

        In this project, you will investigate black hole accretion by running your
        own state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamic simulations.

        Project 2: OTHER POTENTIAL PROJECTS
        I can also offer supervision of projects to study turbulent radiative
        mixing layers, cloud-crushing, galaxy formation &amp; evolution.

        IMPORTANT: 
        (i)   The Computational Astrophysics Summer Program 2024 costs $10,000 USD
              (Payment plans are available, as low as $20/mo).
        (ii)  The goal of the experience is that you perform cutting-edge research
              leading to a publication. Please only apply if you are highly motivated

        <label for="codeExp">Your Coding Experience</label><br>
        <textarea type="text" id="codeExp" name="codeExp" value="">
What exposure have you had to coding / quantum computing so far? This could be through university lectures, online courses, readings, projects (personal or professional) and other means. We're not expecting that you have had much (or any) of this, but we would like to understand what you have done already.

        <label for="goals">Your Goals</label><br>
        <textarea type="text" id="goals" name="goals" value="">
What are you looking to accomplish? This could be your goals for this specific program, but we rather want to know why you want to participate in this program - and what future experiences you may be hoping to land afterwards. What do you hope Ryan can help you with?
        </textarea><br>

        <label for="commit">Your Commitment</label><br>
        <textarea type="text" id="commit" name="commit" value="">
How many hours per week can you commit to working on this research program? What other commitments do you need to juggle? It's perfectly acceptable to have prior engagements or to take vacations, but the more you can put into the program, the more you will get out.
