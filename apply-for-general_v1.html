        <h2 style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">Zero2Code Hands-on Coding Program 2024</h2>
      <p>
        Work on real-world projects, leveling yourself up into a top-tier developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter where you're starting from, even with zero prior coding experience, the program is built to cater to your unique journey. Choose your adventure starting with one of the following tracks:
      </p>

      <p>
        i. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD),<br>
        ii. Web3 (experimental),<br>
        iii. Quantum Computing (experimental+), or<br>
        iv. AI/ML (experimental++)
      </p>
      <p>
        The program will be helmed by the creator of Zero 2 Code, RJF. His guidance and mentorship will be a unique privilege for successful applicants.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Message from <a href="./index.html">RJF</a></strong>: <em>In my web2 life, I study computational astrophysics, particularly galaxy formation and evolution using magnetohydrodynamic simulations and have authored over ten peer-reviewed articles appearing in world-renowned international journals. In my web3 life, I've developed over a dozen different discord bots, minting dapps, and smart contracts (each) for NFT projects. I'm currently developing quantum-accelerated physics-informed neural network [redacted] solvers with a colleague at APL (classified unfortunately) and playing around with post-quantum-cryptography.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
As part of this time-limited opportunity, you'll master UNIX operating systems, git version control, an agile software development lifestyle and more! Inspired by academic research methodologies, each day of the program is designed to be a blend of education and practical application, including an educational task such as attending an interactive lecture, reading a peer-reviewed journal article, or working on textbook exercises. Feel inspired, prototype and build with your new knowledge, and iterate to perfection.
      </p>

      <p>
<u><strong>In the AstroCFD track</strong></u>, you will learn how to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Compile, link, and execute C/C++/Fortran codes utilizing MPI for massively parallel applications.</li>
        <li> Develop your own highly performant modules with an emphasis on parallel scaling and efficiency.</li>
        <li> Analyze and visualize your simulations in Python to solve cutting-edge, scientific mysteries.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
<strong>Real world projects</strong>. Encounter and overcome real hurdles, experience the challenges faced by academics solicited by world-leading tech companies such as RenTec, Google, Meta, and Amazon, and demonstrate your proficiency. Who knows? This may convert into the best job you ever had. Example projects include: (i) Black Hole Accretion: the Interplay between Gravity and Viscous Transport, (ii) When Galaxies Collide: The Shared Fate of The Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies, (iii) Plan(et) B? General Circulation Models for Exo-"Earths", (iv) Save the Earth! Fusion is the Future.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u><strong>In the Web3 track</strong></u>, you will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interface with APIs (e.g., discord, opensea, etherscan)</li>
        <li>Web scrape yourself a dataset even without an API</li>
        <li>Develop your own APIs, websites, and smart contracts - and more!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We strive to gather <strong>bright and curious minds</strong> to collaboratively and rapidly expand your knowledge by solving our sponsor's projects, including (i) web3 code auditing, (ii) building a flight deals discord bot, (iii) on-chain gaming, (iv) dynamic NFTs, (v) yours here!
      </p>

      <p>
        We are looking for highly motivated, self-taught individuals who want to learn how to deploy code to solve real world projects in a fast and stimulating environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u><strong>In the Quantum Computing track</strong></u>, you will
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
Learn how a quantum computer is fundamentally different than computers we regularly use - and how they will change <em><strong>everything.</em></strong>
        </li>
        <li>
Explore popular providers for cloud-based quantum computing: Dwave (LEAP/OCEAN), the world-leading creators of quantum annealers (and overall qubit leader), IBM (Qiskit) the current leader in gate-based quantum computing, and one of the top-leading photonic quantum computing providers.
        </li>
        <li>
Learn the current landscape of post-quantum-cryptography, particularly the top contenders for NIST standardization CRYSTALS-KYBER and Classic McEliece.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
You will immediately start working on real and challenging problems to tackle with QC, learn about state-of-the-art techniques, and be guided by expert mentors. Example projects include: (i) Beating Wall Street: Portfolio Optimization with Quantum Annealing, (ii) Saving the World: Quantum-Accelerated Climate Models, (iii) Out of this World: Quantum-Accelerated Astronomy & Astrophysics, (iv) Quantum-Resistant Real-Time Audio, (v) Quantum-Resistant Electronic Medical Record System, (vi) The Future of DeFi: Quantum-Resistant Smartchains.
